# Unity Seriazable Interfaces
![SerializedInterface](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0006465a-afda-4517-878b-2ce57e933c51)

Serializable Interfaces in Unity give you the ability to drag, drop, and serialize objects that implement a specific interface in Inspector fields, enabling powerful, type-safe assignments. 

Using a custom attribute, you can restrict assignments to components implementing a particular interface. Or use an open generic type that supports serialization of references, enforcing both base types and interface types. This setup leverages custom editor tooling and reflection for seamless Inspector integration, enhanced validation, and intuitive drag-and-drop functionality.


Don't want to serialze yourself but just want the inline hints and drag/drop Inspector framework? Also compatible with the free version of Odin Serializer.
